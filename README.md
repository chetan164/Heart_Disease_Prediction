# Heart_Disease_Prediction
Developed an end-to-end Machine Learning classification system to predict the risk of heart disease using clinical input features and trained models using Python, pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, optimizing for accurate binary classification.  

# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Web App

A Machine Learning–powered **Heart Disease Prediction System** deployed using **Streamlit**.  
Users can input medical attributes like age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, etc., and the app predicts whether they are at risk of heart disease.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow:

- Data collection and preprocessing  
- Model training using classification algorithms  
- Saving the trained model  
- Building a clean & interactive Streamlit UI  
- Deploying the ML model as a web application  

The goal is to allow anyone to test predictions without running code locally.
